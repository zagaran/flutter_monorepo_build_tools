# Flutter Monorepo Build Tools

## Usage

1. `flutter pub get flutter_monorepo_build_tools`
2. `nano monorepo.yaml`
   1. see `monorepo.sample.yaml` for an example of how to configure
3. `dart run flutter_monorepo_build_tools:monorepo_build_tool`

Re-run the tool whenever you add, rename, or remove a local package or if local package dependencies change.

## Config
The Monorepo Build Tool is designed to be as configurable as is reasonably possible. Configuration options
are broadly divisible into two categories: Local Options, which define the behavior of the tool locally
e.g. sourcing files, helping to describe the structure of your file system, etc; and CI options,
which define values specific to whichever CI you are using.


## OOTB CI Support
At release, FMBT only contains out-of-the-box support for CircleCI using the `path-filtering` approach.

To configure your monorepo:

1. Create a source folder to contain your raw CircleCI config. This should include one `config.yml` file and as many `continue-config.yml` type files as you wish.
2. `config.yml` should look something like this: 
```yaml
version: 2.1

# this allows you to use CircleCI's dynamic configuration feature
setup: true

# the path-filtering orb is required to continue a pipeline based on
# the path of an updated fileset
orbs:
  path-filtering: circleci/path-filtering@0.1.1

workflows:
  # the always-run workflow is always triggered, regardless of the pipeline parameters.
  always-run:
    jobs:
      # the path-filtering/filter job determines which pipeline
      # parameters to update.
      - path-filtering/filter:
          name: check-updated-files
          # the mapping key will be automatically generated by flutter_monorepo_build_tools
          base-revision: master
          # this is the path of the configuration we should trigger once
          # path filtering and pipeline parameter value updates are
          # complete.
          config-path: .circleci/continue-config.yml
```
3. Create however many `continue-config.yml` type files you need for your use case. It is important
when naming jobs that they contain the name of your entrypoint directory. For example, if your job 
is related to an app `app`, it should be named something like `app_deploy`. For a full list of matching
globs, see `entrypointPermutations` in `circle_ci_update_manager.dart`.
